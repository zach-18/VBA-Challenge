# VBA-Challenge
Homework #2 (9.11.2020)


I completed the assignment.  I also completed bonus #2, having the macro work on each worksheet.
I did not have time to complete bonus #1, where we capture the max and min increases for each year (tab).

VBA is captured in text files.  14 are included.  The approach makes sense, it is just complicated.  Good to iternate:  start w/ 1 stock ticker, then 2 stock ticker in the for next loop.  then 100. then the tab.  then the whole workbook.
